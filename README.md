# My Photography Portfolio

This is a React app that displays photos from trips, hikes, walks, etc. 

### I'm building this to practice:

- Using Figma to create/plan wireframes
- Practice building a responsive webpage 
- Building reusable styled components to add to my component library 
- Practice using Git branches and the other main functions of Git. Instead of using the main branch for everything
- Writing the least amount of code possible
